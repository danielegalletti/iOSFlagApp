# iOSFlagApp
The FlagApp is a simple iPhone app that integrates SwiftUI, localizables, async/await functions. 
The app can be a useful starting point for many other applications. It requires iOS 15 for simplicity but some modifications can make it compatible also for older versions.
The app uses REST-Countries API to work available at https://restcountries.com.
